# Hi ðŸ‘‹

CIO & Enterprise BU Manager at **Acid Labs**. I build cloud-native platforms with security, reliability, and AI governance as first principles.

I focus on platform engineering, DevSecOps, test automation (digital assurance), observability/SLOs, and compliance-aligned delivery (e.g., ISO 27001/42001, SOC 2).

## Current interests
AI Governance, Cloud (major providers), Kubernetes, IaC, CI/CD, policy as code, supply-chain security (signing, SBOMs), tracing/metrics/logs.

> Opinions are my own.
